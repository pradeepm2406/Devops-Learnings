MAVEN:

>> Apache Maven is a open source project management tool
>> Maven is build on concept of Project Object Model (POM) just as ANT is build on build.xml. Maven needs pom.xml to execute the build process.
>> Maven is used for 
    -- Project Build
    -- Dependency Management
    -- Installing and
    -- Deploying the build to local and remote repositories

MAVEN BUILD LIFECYCLE:

>> Maven build lifecycle is nothing but the sequence of tasks that are executed when the Maven Build is run
>> There are three built-in build lifecycles:
    - Default
    - Clean
    - Site
>> Maven build lifecycle goes through a set of stages, known as build phases.
>> Each build Phase is made up of set of goals.
>> Maven goals are nothing but a specific task that contributes to the building and managing of a project.

The following are the Maven Build Phases:
 -- Validate => Check if all information neccesary for the build is available.

 -- Compile  => Compile the source code.

 -- Test => Run unit tests.

 -- Package => package the compiled source code into the distributed format (.jar,.war etc)

 -- Verify => run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met.

 -- Install => Install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally. 

 -- Deploy => Copy the package to the local or remote repository.
